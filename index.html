Solana is a high-performance blockchain that uses a combination of proof-of-stake (<strong>PoS</strong>) and proof-of-history (<strong>PoH</strong>) to validate transactions and process them quickly. It processes thousands of transactions per second (TPS), making it one of the fastest blockchains in the world.<br><br><strong><a href="https://solscan.io/" class="text-primary">Solscan </a></strong>interacts directly with Solana’s blockchain nodes to gather data and display it in an easily understandable format. The Solana blockchain, like other decentralized networks, stores a wide array of information, and <strong>Solscan </strong>fetches this data and visualizes it for users.<br><br>When you visit <strong>Solscan</strong>, you can input transaction hashes, wallet addresses, or block numbers to retrieve detailed information related to that specific query. <strong>Solscan </strong>also allows you to filter data according to various parameters, such as token types or transaction status, which helps users to navigate the vast amount of data generated on the Solana network.<br><br><strong>Key Features of <a href="https://solscan.io/" class="text-primary">Solscan</a><br></strong><br><strong><a href="https://solscan.io/" class="text-primary">Solscan </a></strong>offers a variety of features that make it a valuable tool for both developers and general users within the Solana ecosystem.<br><br><strong>1. Real-Time Transaction Tracking :-<br></strong><br>One of the most important features of <strong>Solscan </strong>is its ability to track transactions in real time. Users can search for transactions by their hash, sender’s or receiver’s wallet addresses, or block height. Once a transaction is initiated, <strong>Solscan </strong>tracks its progress and updates its status, showing whether it is confirmed, pending, or failed.<br><br>This feature is particularly important for traders, developers, and anyone who needs to verify transaction completion or monitor real-time blockchain activity. <strong>Solscan </strong>also provides detailed information on the transaction, including the amount, fees, and timestamp.<br><br><strong>2. Comprehensive Wallet and Address Details :-<br></strong><br><strong><a href="https://solscan.io/" class="text-primary">Solscan </a></strong>lets users explore individual wallet addresses to view their balances, transaction history, and token holdings. Wallet owners can easily track all assets within their wallets, including SOL (Solana’s native token) and any Solana-based tokens that may be held.<br><br>You can also look up the historical activity of a wallet, which includes incoming and outgoing transactions, token transfers, and the gas fees associated with each action. This transparency is especially useful for those who wish to track a wallet’s activity or verify whether certain transactions have occurred.<br><br><strong>3. Detailed Token Information :-<br></strong><br><strong><a href="https://solscan.io/" class="text-primary">Solscan </a></strong>doesn’t only display information about Solana’s native token (<strong>SOL</strong>) but also supports tokens issued on the Solana blockchain. Through Solscan, users can track any Solana-based token’s transaction history, contract details, and holder distribution.<br><br>Users can also access data such as token market statistics, the total supply of a token, and real-time pricing data.
